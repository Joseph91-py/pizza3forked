Pizza3 - WORKSHOP - PostTreatment - Part 1
INRAE\Han Chen, Olivier Vitrac - rev. 2023-08-25
Synopsis
The workshop is organized into two interconnected parts to demonstrate how spatial and temporal information can be reconstructed from the dynamics of multi-particle systems, as utilized in Pizza3. The workshop focuses on managing large data files generated from MD-like simulations that contain atomistic information such as positions, velocities, forces, and more. Through specific post-treatment, these details are converted into meaningful time or spatial averages or fluctuating quantities.

Part 1: Temporal Information Extraction
Objective: To extract temporal information from large dump files (5-100 GB) generated by LAMMPS that are beyond the processing capacity of conventional computers.
Applied Physics: The section emphasizes simple physical concepts, aiming to illustrate how scalar quantities can be retrieved and plotted with low computational cost.
Key Learnings:
Preprocessing of large files.
Analysis of temporal evolution for selected particles.
Study of solid obstacle dynamics (including position and movement, shape deformation, and moment of inertia analysis).

Part 2: Spatial Reconstruction and Field Analysis
Objective: Utilizing the results from Part 1, this section aims to reconstruct various fields (velocity, stresses) through the definitions of underlying physics and kernel interpolation.
Key Learnings:
First description of fluid-solid interactions.
Visualization techniques.
Overview of possible extensions.
Overall, the workshop provides hands-on experience and detailed understanding of translating complex particle dynamics into meaningful physical insights, with an emphasis on efficient computational methodologies.
